## üëã Introduction

This repository is for my homelab which combineds Proxmox VE with Kubernetes using K3s. It's based on the k8s-at-home [flux template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template). It's supported by [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/), [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/), bitwarden-cli for external-secrets, Longhorn storage as well as GlusterFS for democratic-csi and additional NFS cluster storage options.

## ü§ù Thanks

Learning Kubernetes has been great. Thanks to the people at k8s-at-home, I've taken, worked with people that are friendly and helpful, and finally been able to really start learning something I'd put off for years, because of my disdain for what Docker did so many years ago with it's first clobbering of my 172.18.0.0/22 desktop network because my server network is on 172.17.0.0/16.
